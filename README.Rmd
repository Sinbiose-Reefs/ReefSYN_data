Target journal: Earth System Science Data

Here we present the raw figures of the datapaper. We adopted the Darwin Core Standard to organize the 16 datasets. The root R script "RUN_TO_ORGANIZE_DATA_INTO_DwC.R" can be used to generate these organized datasets from raw datasets. By running this script you will create the folder 'DwC_output' which will host the processed datasets (most of them in a particular folder; exceptions are datasets II and XII (fish and benthos from the ABrolhos Bank), and XI and XVI (fish and benthos from Rio Grande do Norte state), which were produced by the same researchers). Main data updates are listed in the end of this file. 

Folders in this project:

- **Data**: raw datasets. Each dataset folder has its own R script to organize data (DwC standard);

- **DwC_output**: the processed data, after running each organization script;

- **Policy**: policies of authorship and data sharing (only Portuguese);

- **R**: folder with R scripts. Scratch of a Shiny App;
