# Paper section 1: Who are we?

The leveraging of ecological synthesis has two main reasons: ecology is
entering in the age of big data (Wuerst et al. 2020, GEB) and applying
the principles of open science (UNESCO 2020). We are now experiencing a
transition from isolated research, with data stored in the drawer, to a
global research network with data stored in public repositories
available to be used to leverage further research (Reich et al. 2011).
Brazil just started to go in this direction, with recent initiatives
such as the LattesData (CNPq) and the Brazilian Institute of Synthesis
(Sinbiose, see <http://www.sinbiose.cnpq.br/web/sinbiose/home>), both
comprising pioneer initiatives in South America in terms of data storage
capability and application of open-science principles (UNESCO 2020).
There are seven working groups funded by the Sinbiose institute, being
the ReefSYN–Reef Synthesis Working Group–the only group working with
marine ecosystems (particularly coral and rocky reefs of the Brazilian
marine biogeographical province (Spalding et al. 2007)).

The ReefSYN is a team of 20 young and senior researchers, and 2
post-doctoral researchers, from several countries and institutions,
interested in several dimensions of reef biodiversity, and on associated
ecosystem services (Fig. 1). Our team is specially engaged in achieving
a common objective: *To provide a synthesis about patterns and drivers
of reef diversity and supplying of ecological services in Brazil*. More
information about our group can be found at
<https://reefsyn.weebly.com/home-us.html>.

# Paper section 2: Spatial distribution of spatial and temporal data gathered by the ReefSYN Working Group

Natural to ecological synthesis is the use of big data (both in terms of
amount of data and heterogeneity on data). To achieve our objective, we
are analyzing data from almost 400 unique localities distributed
throughout the Brazilian coast and oceanic islands, thus embracing a
wide latitudinal range: from 0.91 to -27.6 latitude degrees. In these
localities, we gathered already published data, as well yet unpublished
data of fish and benthic communities–generated by geographically
replicated, large-scale research programs conducted over the last
decades in Brazilian coast and oceanic islands (SISBOTA-MAR, PELD-ILOC,
or yet personal, novel initiatives such as the monitoring of reef fish
and benthos of Rio Grande do Norte and Abrolhos Bank)–to create this
large database. We also have data collected beyond the Brazilian coast
(e.g., Longo et al. 2019, GEB), and species-level trait dataset that
includes Brazilian corals (Bleuel et al., unpublished data) and benthos
(Aued et al., unpublished data), and Atlantic and Eastern Pacific fishes
(Quimbayo et al., 2021). Below we present the map with the spatial
distribution of localities included in all fish and benthic datasets
(see legend, Fig. 2).

fish (left) per dataset.

# Paper section 3: Temporal trends on data acquisition

The dataset presented here reunite information from several independent
efforts to characterize the marine biodiversity of the Brazilian
province (Fig. 3). In terms of the cumulative efforts, in terms of the
cumulative number of eventIDs across the datasets over time, We can see
that i) there were an abrupt increase in the number of eventIDs after
2013, mainly for benthos (probably leveraged by the Sisbiota-Mar project
(CNPq)), and ii) that the data included in several initiatives (e.g.,
Sisbiota-Mar, PELD ILOC) gather data from past expeditions (i.e., prior
to the grant).

The number of sampling events per dataset is as follows for benthos:

| samplingProtocol        | eventIDs | Dataset           |
|:------------------------|---------:|:------------------|
| Photoquadrats           |      345 | Sisbiota-Mar      |
| Photoquadrats           |      285 | RN monitoring     |
| Photoquadrats 50 X 50cm |     2748 | PELD ILOC         |
| Photoquadrats           |       24 | Coastal snapshots |
| Point-intercept lines   |      649 | Abrolhos Bank     |
| Fixed photo-quadrats    |      649 | Abrolhos Bank     |

And for fish

| samplingProtocol                   | eventIDs | Dataset            |
|:-----------------------------------|---------:|:-------------------|
| Underwater visual survey - 20 x 2m |      800 | RN monitoring      |
| Video plot                         |      378 | Sisbiota-Mar (VP)  |
| Underwater Visual Survey - 20 x 2m |     3480 | PELD ILOC          |
| Stationary visual census - 4 x 2m  |     6422 | Abrolhos Bank      |
| Underwater visual survey - 20 x 2m |     2146 | Arraial do Cabo    |
| Underwater visual survey - 20 x 2m |     4570 | Sisbiota-Mar (UVC) |
| Underwater visual survey - 20 x 2m |     1897 | Santa Catarina     |

The number of sampling events is distributed in time as follows:

in which data included in each Dataset started to be collected. The
horizontal bars depict the formal funding as follows: dark gray bar:
Sisbiota, CNPq; light gray bar: PELD, CNPq; green bar: ReefSYN, Sinbiose
CNPq.

# Paper section 4: Temporal trends on the number of species

It is also natural that the cumulative effort result in an increased
scientific knowledge regarding the number of identified species and/or
taxon (in the case of benthos). Here, we counted the cumulative number
of scientific names/taxon names (after a checking with the WORMS
database, using the R package “worrms”). As can be seen in Fig. 4, there
was a nearly constant increase in the number of fish scientific names
over time. In contrast, for benthos, there were several years of
constancy interspaced by years of abrupt increase in the number of
species (Fig. 4).

### Fish communities from the Brazilian province

This Dataset, used by Morais et al. 2017 (Journal of Fish Biology),
includes fish counts in 4,570 transects distributed over 137 sites in 20
different localities from 0 to 27°S latitude degrees (including oceanic
islands). The Dataset includes fish counts and size estimates. Sampling
descriptors include Observer ID, site depth, and date. The geographical
information is at the site (not transect) level. Data and metadata are
available
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Wn4n66sVPoj3YBT1kGFUE2FuMyPq4Iic).
These data were generated by the team of [SISBIOTA Mar
project](http://www.sisbiota.ufsc.br/). All documentation describing the
edits in this Dataset (for use of the ReefSYN) can be found \[here\] ().

### Benthic communities from the Brazilian province

This Dataset, used by Aued et al. 2018 (PlosOne) \[data also published
at ?????\], includes the cover of benthic organisms into 3,855
photoquadrats deployed in 40 sites in 15 different localities from 0 to
27°S latitude degrees. Benthic organisms were identified at several
taxonomic levels (morphotype, species, order). Sampling descriptors
include photoquadrat ID, site depth, date and, for some samples,
observer ID. The geographical information is at the site (not transect)
level. Data and metadata are available
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sgILttlP6HQ1KOHV5yuyQouLe6Pscjlj).
These data were generated by the team of [SISBIOTA Mar
project](http://www.sisbiota.ufsc.br/).

### Benthic communities from the Brazilian province (Ronaldo Francini-Filho)

This dataset was compiled by Erika Santana, Anaíde Aued, and Ronaldo
Francini-Filho, and consists in data of benthic organisms sampled in
photoquadrats deployed in several sites disposed along the coast and
oceanic islands. Benthic organisms were identified at several taxonomic
levels (morphotype, species, order). The dataset originally had
environmental descriptors such as site depth, month and year (not in DwC
standard). Data and metadata are available
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1o0S5-u1GAPSLwg8P5zzl11xzx4X5pxIU).

### Trophic interactions along the Western Atlantic

This Dataset, used by Longo et al. 2019 (Global Ecology and
Biogeograhy), includes records of the interactions between fishes and
benthic organisms. These data were obtained with 1,133 unique videoplots
deployed in 70 sites in 17 different localities from 34°N to 27°S.
Sampling descriptors include recording time, date, depth, and observed
ID. No geographical information besides site ID is available. Data and
metadata are available
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/126xLZ6Z3xKO_pIT1IfGNj268Qy7E_Lo7).

### Fish and benthic communities from Rio Grande do Norte

Data collected by Guilherme Longo and Natália Roos in Rio Grande do
Norte. Data of fishes and benthos were collected in the same spatial
unit: within a transect of 20m2 used to register fishes, they deployed
10 photoquadrats to register benthic organisms. These data were used by
N Roos [Roos et al. 2019](https://www.int-res.com/prepress/m13005.html)
and are available
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1WG68D_QAPKIZbZhYZmFOenOdUjejnjXn).

## Temporal data

### Benthic communities from oceanic islands

Two Datasets of benthic communities registered in the Fernando de
Noronha Archipelago and Rocas Atoll from 2013 to 2018. These data were
shared by Sérgio Floeter are are available
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1DXrcYH3yCbknkEuqpGG59m89LbDJpzVJ).
Data from Trindade Island and Martiz Vaz Archipelago, Abrolhos, and
Saint Peter and Saint Paul’s Archipelago will be available soon. These
data were generated by the team of [PELD ILOC
project](http://peldiloc.sites.ufsc.br/).

## Trait data

### Atlantic and Eastern Pacific fishes

Unpublished data collected by Juan Pablo Quimbayo and collaborators.
These data include functional traits of 2,153 fish species. Traits
describe activity, size, diet, distribution, and fishing price. Data and
metadata can be found
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1aG6zlU5uoeLEPwwdnRKoTAqvldBmyJsp).

### Benthos from the Brazilian province

Unpublished data collected by Anaide Aued and collaborators. These data
include functional traits of more than 100 taxa of benthic organisms.
Traits describe mobility, size, growth form, trophic level, and
accretion capacity. Data and metadata can be found
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1H54FZnBRwdF-ZdDkJ7hjB4ZnyBULspV8).

### Corals of the Brazilian province

Unpublished data collected J Bleuel and collaborators. These data
include functional traits of 24 coral species. Traits describe
reproduction mode and period, growth rate and form, and tolerance to
depth, light, and temperature. These data can be found
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vQp0xz_AMqepVbg1sbrFk1lvsjo_ecYL).

## Spatial polygons

We are using the most updated, yet unpublished spatial data of marine
protected and priority areas (year 2018), from Brazilian Institute for
Biodiversity Conservation (‘ICMBIO’). These data contain six shapefiles
with spatial data about conservation priority areas, artisanal fishing,
and implementation cost, urgency, and opportunity. These data were
produced by the team of AP Prates, were shared by Carlos Eduardo
Ferreira, and can be found
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Xra9owUYi0dK_T4l8WEn-aH7QnTk6ZtH).

## Brazilian Protected Areas

Finally, we have spatial data on Brazilian Protected Areas that can be
used in many steps of the project. These spatial data were shared by
Rafael Magris (ICMBio) and can be found \[here\] ().

## How can you access these data?

Published data can be found at their on-line repositories. Unpublished
data are only available to ReefSyn members, as defined by our “Policy of
data sharing and use” (available
